                            </div>
                            <p>We are committed to carry out all work lawfully, ethically and with integrity. All forms of bribery and 
                                corruption are unacceptable and will not be tolerated. This also applies to any third party acting on our behalf, as a 
                                representative of our company.</p>
                            <p>This anti-bribery and corruption policy sets out SSBC’s policies to prevent acts of bribery and corruption. If you have any 
                                issues or questions on this policy, please seek advice from a member of staff. This policy applies to all employees, management, 
                                directors of SSBC and of any company that completes services on our behalf. This is a single standard across the board and all 
                                employees are expected to read, understand and agree to these terms and conditions as part of their working contract. We also 
                                conduct training with relevant employees to ensure these practices are updated if required.</p>
                            <p>It is also important to ensure our service providers, agents, partners all abide by the same anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies. 
                                To ensure we continually monitor the ethics of our providers, it is first important to clearly understand both bribery and corruption.</p>

                                <h6>Definition of Bribery:</h6>
                            </div>
                            <p>Bribery is the offering, promising, giving, accepting or soliciting of an advantage as an inducement for an action which is illegal, 
                                unethical or a breach of trust. Many types of payments or favours can constitute bribes: tips, gifts, favours, discount, 
                                waived fees, free foods, free advertising, free trips, free tickets, donations, campaign contribution, sponsorship/backing, promotions. 
                                The key to identifying bribery is that it is intended to alter the recipient’s behaviour.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>Corruption is receiving, asking for or giving any gratification to induce a person to do a favour with a corrupt intent. 
                                As such, it’s considered to be an abuse of power. Corruption occurs when someone in a position of power uses their authority to influence 
                                decisions or conducts any other dishonest or fraudulent behaviour like giving or accepting bribes.
                                All forms of bribery and corruption are strictly prohibited. Any breach of this policy will be met with disciplinary 
                                action and possible dismissal. It is also important to ensure that any person acting on behalf of SSBC also abide by this policy.

                            <p>All third parties who are involved in offering services should be made aware of the terms and
                                conditions of Anti-bribery and corruption before representing our company. Under no
                                circumstance should a company ever engage with a third party who is engaging in bribery. It
                                is also important for us as a service provider to mitigate the risk of bribery and corruption
                                with third parties. The correct due diligence is required when deciding trusted companies:</p>
