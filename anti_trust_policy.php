                                producers of a good or service to control supply in the hope to regulate or manipulate prices.</p>
                            <p>A collection of independent businesses or countries that act together like a single producer,
                                cartel members may agree on prices, total industry output, market shares, allocation of
                                customers, allocation of territories, and the division of profits.</p>
